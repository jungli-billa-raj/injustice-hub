Here are all the planning related to this project called Injustice Hub. 

1. Understand the problem. 
-> In a country like India, bad news comprise major part of daily news. This has made people somewhat insensitive and indifferent to the pain and sufferings happening to the people of this nation on a daily basis. Now, I by no means expect a software to eradicate this collosal problem. But, wouldn't it be great to have a software that can provide you the details of all the crimials(both individuals and organizations) between a 'start_date' and 'end_date' ? 
This seems novelty at first but it will really be of great use. (a.) It will not let people forget. Even if the people forget, the database will remember. (b.) For a future justice seeking entity, this database will be a goldmine of identifying the perpetrators.
